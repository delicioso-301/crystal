# Crystal  

Crystal is a website that is created as a fake "life predictor" or a gag fortune teller. The user can enter their date of birth and search, to which an album, movie and celebrity will be returned. This information represents the following:

1. Album: the soundtrack of your life
2. Movie: the way your life will end up
3. Celeb: your ideal best friend
	
The minimum viable product (MVP) for this project is to have the user be able to search for the details related to their birthday.
